					<h2>My Contributions</h2>

					<div class="section">
						<h3><a href="CMSPRESENTATIONPAGE.html">Presentation Page</a></h3>
						<p>I created the Presentation page as an introductory landing page for our website. The page features a welcoming message and introduces our team members. I designed it with a visually appealing background and used CSS for styling, including hover effects and responsive design. JavaScript is utilized to automatically redirect users to the home page after a brief delay, providing a smooth transition into the main website.</p>

					<div class="section">
						<h3><a href="CMSSIGNUP.html">Sign Up Page</a></h3>
						<p>I developed the Sign Up page with a focus on user experience and data validation. The page features a clean, responsive design with a video background for visual appeal. I implemented comprehensive JavaScript validation for all form fields, including email format and password strength checks. The form submission process includes a thank you message and smooth transition, enhancing the overall user experience.</p>

					<div class="section">
						<h3><a href="CMSGALLERY.html">Gallery page</a></h3>
						<p>I designed and implemented the Gallery page, showcasing our bakery's products and ambiance. The page features a responsive grid layout with hover effects for each image. I used JavaScript to create an interactive experience, allowing users to view larger images and read associated quotes or descriptions. The gallery is divided into two sections, enhancing the visual appeal and organization of our content.</p>
