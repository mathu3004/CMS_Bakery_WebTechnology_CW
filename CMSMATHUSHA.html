					<h2>My Contributions</h2>

					<div class="section">
						<h3><a href="CMSHOME.html">Main Page</a></h3>
						<p>I worked on the main page independently, with help in choosing the theme and colors. Together, we created a logo, and I added significant CSS to give the page an elegant look. I implemented JavaScript for animations. I used JavaScript to validate each field of the query form and customize the order form. <br>Upon submission, a window pops up with a summary of the form.</p>
						<p>All navigation buttons have a hover effect and an active current website notification effect using JavaScript. I added a promotional popup window to promote the quiz. I shared the header and footer with other members. We maintained the same theme throughout all sites of our webpage.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="section">
						<h3><a href="CMSDISCOUNTQUIZ.html">Quiz Page</a></h3>
						<p>I created the quiz page using the prompt and alert functions to display quiz questions and details. JavaScript is extensively used for randomly selecting questions, calculating the score, and results are displayed on the same page with different colors based on the score.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="section">
						<h3><a href="ABOUTCMS.html">About CMS Page</a></h3>
						<p>I developed the About CMS page, which includes sections for the mission, vision, team members, and history. The design is kept simple and clean.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="section">
						<h3><a href="CMSORDER&DELIVERY.html">Order and Delivery Procedure Page</a></h3>
						<p>I created the Order and Delivery page, detailing the order process, delivery procedures, charges, and areas served. HTML tables are used to present delivery charges.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="section">
						<h3><a href="CMSVACANCY.html">Vacancy Form Page</a></h3>
						<p>I developed the Vacancy Form page, ensuring each field is validated using comprehensive JavaScript knowledge. A confirmation popup is displayed upon form submission.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="section">
						<h3><a href="CMSFAQ.html">FAQ Page</a></h3>
						<p>I designed the FAQ page using tables to present frequently asked questions, categorized by topics for easy navigation.</p>
